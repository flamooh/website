<em>the area where everyone was at basically</em></p>

<p>in writing this blog post, i hope to document stuff most things from my old minecraft
server that i had hosted for my friends so that i don’t have to load up this huge world
and its RAM-hungry mods every time i wanna look at something.</p>

<p><strong>SCP: Lockdown</strong> and <strong>Parasites</strong> were the two most popular mods that were hosted on the server,
though I think people eventually found parasites annoying (me too)… and there were a few who really
liked <strong>Thaumcraft</strong> too so i don’t want to forget that one. i got around to calling this world “aceSCP” 
because well… i couldn’t remember if I even gave my server a name when I hosted this for my friends.
however, i really needed a name to call the backup of this world.
so… the one main thing i remember from this server was my friend Ace overseeing a big ass SCP
facility and <em>ta-da</em> that’s where the name is inspired from. 
<br /></p>

<p>when it came time to close the server due to dying interest, i archived the world just for keepsake and made a lil
replaymod cinematic of me running around the world. it was a way to not only stress my GPU a lil to see how it could
record videos, but also for me to make a visual archive of most of the structures
made by my friends. </p>
<p>seeing everyone's build
in the video is nice looking back at it. i think its sweet my friends and i came 
together to make something cool and fun to play around with during the downtime. thank you
to whoever played on this server. thank you to my friends who stuck with me when
i troubleshooted the fuck out of this server.</p>
<p> and to those wondering the kickass songs used in the video... here u are:
(in order of appearance on video)</p>

<h1 id="so-how-many-times-did-people-die">so, how many times did people die?</h1>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/deaths.jpg" alt="map" />
<br>
<em>well…</em></p>

<p>the crazy thing about this scoreboard is that if there was actually someone who <strong>NEVER DIED</strong>, we wouldn’t be able
to see. if anyone actually did that, props to you.</p>

<p>having the death counter was fun to have. in my opinion, those who had more than 14 deaths were either <strong>REALLY</strong>
negligent or just stopped giving a fuck. not to put anyone down who had more than 14 deaths though, tough as nails
mod really was a pain.</p>

<p>let’s look at some buildings now :)</p>

<h1 id="buildings-buildings--buildings">buildings, buildings &amp; buildings</h1>

<h3 id="the-barn">the barn</h3>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/barn/1.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/barn/2.jpg" /></p>
<p> never figured out who's barn this was... its cute &amp; all but whoever
built this, your cows miss you alot. no joke, when I went
inside to take the screenshot, there were two cows letting
out crying moos. 
</p>
<p> anyways, this is a nice simple barn. it really is just
a humble place someone made to breed animals and get
some food. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</p>
<h3 id="fraxs-house--chapel">frax’s house &amp; chapel(?)</h3>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/1.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/2.jpg" />
<em>shoutout to whoever built the sign on the well</em></p>

<p> aside from ace's big ass SCP facility, there's also
these two tall structures. we're going to be focusing on the
house first since there's actually a lot to it below the surface.
</p>

<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/3.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/4.jpg" /></p>
<p> i don't know why, but I thought the inside was supposed
to depict some sort of tea party, but it was really just a kitchen.
looking around inside, im realizing more that getting the fairy
lights mod was a great decision. these lights are so pretty..
</p>

<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/b1.jpg" /></p>
<p> once you climb down the ladder, there is really a shit ton
of stuff in here</p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/b2.jpg" /></p>
<p> aside from some novelty items on the wall and the recurrence of the beloved
fairy light, most of this space right below the kitchen is used
for stashing tons of stuff, smelting stuff, and crafting for
mod items too i think
</p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/b3.jpg" /></p>
<p>whoops almost forgot, there's also a kitchen here too! while being cutesy, this also
makes for a really good doomsday shelter when shit hits the fan.
</p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/c1.jpg" /></p>
<p>now we stumble upon a nice, gentle looking hobbit home. but, bare with me here.
</p>
<video width="1096" height="362" controls="">
  <source src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/alone.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  download the
  <a href="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/alone.mp4">MP4</a>
  video so you can see what im talking about!!
</video>
<p> please watch this video. should your device not support video embeds, feel
free to <a> href="https://flamoh.com/blog/pics/aceSCP/frax/alone.mp4"download</a> and come back when you're done.</p>

<p> listen carefully to the surroundings. what do you notice/hear? if there's anything to take away from this video, this ghost town
of a hobbit home is really chilling. the first thing i immediately noticed
when i walked inside this bedroom was the ticking clock which just added
to the uneasy vibe i was getting. bravo to dynamic surroundings / sound filters mod for doing its thing, but to
be home alone here would be hell. </p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/c6.jpg" /></p>
<p> and knowing you're open to a cave full of who knows what just makes it worse... </p>
<p>sorry, <strong>WHO THE HELL CARES???</strong> i know.. it’s just minecraft.<br />
it’s fun to think about though :P</p>

<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/c2.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/c3.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/c4.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/c5.jpg" /></p>
<p> aside from any aural oddities in this house, like i
said with the kitchen, this would make for a really nice place
to camp out in during a doomsday event. that fireplace is sick.</p>

<h4 id="the-chapel">the chapel</h4>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/d1.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/frax/d2.jpg" /></p>
<p> you can tell the people building in this server really love
fairy lights and i'm all for it.</p>
<p> i can't remember what this building was called, but i'm going
to assume it was a chapel because of the bell on the top. going inside,
there isn't anything, but it doesn't take away from how neat this thing
looks.</p>

<h4 id="athan">athan</h4>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/athan/1.jpg" /></p>
<p> as the sign on the house says, this is the "athan".<br />
however, this thing is a marvel of engineering.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/athan/engineering.gif" /></p>
<p> sliding doors when you enter<br />
and a heating coil to survive the harsh winter of aceSCP.</p>

<h2 id="acescp-special-the-pets-and-their-homes-brought-to-you-by-mocreatures">aceSCP Special: The Pets and their Homes! Brought to you by MoCreatures.</h2>
<p>time to take a little break from buildings.</p>

<h5 id="introducing-carlisle">Introducing Carlisle</h5>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/pets/carlisle.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/pets/carlisleHome.jpg" /></p>
<p> This here is Carlisle. As shown by their little
home near the middle of the aceSCP town, they are a
Wyvern belonging to shineepeppr. They have a trapdoor hatch
on the top of their house so that they can fly in and out
of the house when needed by their owner. Since Carlisle is mountable,
you can imagine that the owner can get wherever they need to be
really fast.</p>

<h5 id="introducing-gimli">Introducing Gimli</h5>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/pets/gimli.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/pets/gimliHome.jpg" /></p>
<p> This here is Gimli. This Manticore's owner
is unknown sadly (atleast by me), but whoever
owns them built them a nice, open area for them
to roam around with in the town! If their area
is open as shown in the picture, they must be friendly.</p>
<p><em>looking back at it, im concerned if the broken blocks are from gimli or from someone else… hopefully not gimli</em></p>

<p><strong>That does it for this aceSCP Special! Back to looking at buildings.</strong></p>

<h4>?</h4>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/idk.jpg" /></p>
<p>
to start back up, we have an unknown building.  
my guess that this is supposed to serve a function for a certain mod.. (maybe thaumcraft cus there's runic symbols on the block in the middle)  
if anyone who played on the server actually stumbles upon this blog entry, let me know and i'll update this</p>

<p><em>for now this is unknown</em></p>

<h4 id="peppr-lemon--antons-house">peppr, lemon &amp; anton’s house</h4>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/palHouse/1.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/palHouse/2.jpg" /></p>
<p>how this was able to fit three people... i don't even remember  
or maybe i was just using the house for chest and just being a nomad for the rest of the time lol  </p>
<p>i have a peppr bias so i think this is my favorite building of the rest </p>
<p> seriously, i think this has the best decoration of like any place. i'm not good with words, but i
think it's okay for me to say that this has a coherent theme with colors. the lights go sooo well with
the warm colors of the house, and i think there is alot of clever prop usage outside the house that gives it personality.
</p>

<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/palHouse/3.jpg" />
<img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/palHouse/4.jpg" /></p>
<p> one thing i noticed in the server is that my friends
are really nice at putting together interiors. every building
has their own personal touch to it, and really i know it sounds like
im over complicating a fucking minecraft building, but that's what
sounds good in my head. my friends just know what should go where
and i like that.</p>

<h1 id="aces-scp-facility">Ace’s SCP Facility</h1>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/ace/1.jpg" /></p>
<p> had to give this one the biggest header out of every
building showcased on this blog because it influenced the name.
this one is important guys.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/ace/2.jpg" /></p>
<p> do you see how huge this thing is??? had to be put to the side
because this a whole nother town just on its own. this was dedicated solely
to ace's SCP experiments, which I didn't mind because I think he was the first
to be vocal for adding this mod. he wanted to play around with the mod, and im 
glad he made the most of it.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/ace/3.jpg" /></p>
<p> i would go in depth about this building because of how massive it is, but
alot of it deals with SCPs, something that i know jack about. i dont want to 
walk into one of the buildings and not know what im talking about, but i can talk
about one cool SCP that i know about which ace and my friend zek showed me.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/ace/4.jpg" /></p>
<p> just wanted to get this out the way, SCPs can make a pretty garden. thumbs up! </p>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/ace/6.jpg" /></p>
<p> and i saw this while roaming the place. looks like the backrooms.</p>
<p> okay now i'll talk about the SCP..</p>
<h4 id="the-pizza-scp">the pizza SCP</h4>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/ace/5.jpg" />
<strong>THIS PIZZA IS MAGIC. ITS EXISTENCE IS TOO BROKEN.</strong><br />
<strong>ONE BOX. INFINITE PIZZAS.</strong></p>

<p>just did a google search and apparently this is <em>SCP-458</em>. what’s funny is that the SCP
states that the SCP itself is a little ceasers box. typing this entry up, I was literally
thinking about this being a Hot-N-Ready box without even knowing the SCP’s story lolol</p>

<p>but yeah you can imagine with a never-ending pizza box like this, all food items we previously
had could be rendered useless unless you didn’t have the box. eating a slice replenished a good
amount of hunger too.</p>

<h1 id="the-end">the end</h1>
<p><img src="../../../../pics/aceSCP/work.png" /></p>
<p> that's that on aceSCP. i went through a good amount of the server that I found, and in fact this isn't the only
minecraft server i hosted for my friends. but this is one that i just had whose backup was conveniently laying around. i find it funny
people would ask me to start the server when they wanted to play since at the time, i had it running on my PC and didnt
want to pay for hosting, and free hosting was just ehh, i wanted to tweak stuff and etc </p>

<p> i did a decent amount of work to get this blog entry working. was it hard? i dont think it'd be fair to say that.
it could give someone a small headache though. but was it fun? yes. getting jekyll to make this blog actually display and getting that forge server running with mods i hadnt
downloaded in a while to get that 3D render of the map with dynmap was worth it. </p>
