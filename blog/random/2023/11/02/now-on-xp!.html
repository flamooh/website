<p>just wanted to share... this website can run on XP! *with exceptions*</p>
<p>it really depends on what browser you use. I.E. DON'T USE IE or an old browser.
in this video, I used the last supported Firefox build for XP which was 52 ESR i think.</p>
<p>this is a SONY VAIO laptop that I grew up with. it has a penitum 4 and an ATI card
that I forgot was called. younger me would freak out that i was able to register my own domain
and have it display. younger me would also freak out that i was able to have my own blog with
images and videos.</p>
<p> nice trivia, autumn theme on the homepage made an appearance! it matched the wallpaper i put on the laptop
at the time of recording! i used bliss as a kid, but i remember autumn fondly too, and looking back at it,
if i had to choose a wallpaper i would use autumn. something about it just seems so calm and welcoming.
<p> on the laptop, i messed with a bunch of stuff. i had the Plus! XP edition so i had some games like
HyperBowl, Labryinth, and also i messed with 3D Space Pinball / Cailou Reading. if anyone remembers PBS Kids Home, i 
messed with that too. i loved the office 2000 assistants (earth and clippy
are the best), and used a lot of word to make short books.
<p> so to younger me, you can find us on flamoh.com and my ramblings with /blog after the domain. :)</p>
